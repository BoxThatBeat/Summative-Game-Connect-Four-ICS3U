### Methods for the program
* Print the board
* Print the rules
* Take users' input
* Take users' input and place it on the board
* Error checker
* Win condition checker

### To-do List
1. ~~Create java file with the class file and main method~~
2. ~~Create the 2D array for the game board, get a sense for how 2D arrays work~~
3. ~~Create the board and have it printed~~
