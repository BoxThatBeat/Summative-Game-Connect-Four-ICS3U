### Goals
* Have a functioning game
* A nice and simple UI for easy interaction
* A nice list for the rules of the game
* Efficent use of code (Clean and effective)
* Have the program recognize win conditions for horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions
* Have the board load into the console smoothly

#### Going further
* Possibly create a data system that records each players' moves throughout the game and lets the user access them after a game has finished 
* Implement an AI/computer opponent (using minimax algorithm or by conceptualizing my own AI)
* MAKE A GUI

---

### Methods for the program
* Print the board
* Print the rules
* Take user input, error checker inside that method
* Take user input and place it on the board
* Win condition checker
* Set up the board
* Restarting the game

### To-do List
1. ~~Create java file with the class file and main method~~
2. ~~Create the 2D array for the game board, get a sense for how 2D arrays work~~
3. ~~Create the board and have it printed~~
4. ~~Create a list of rules for the game~~
5. ~~Create a system to take in users inputs and place it on the board~~
6. ~~Make a method for user inputs~~
7. ~~Allow more than one colour to appear on the game board (two player functionality)~~
8. ~~Make a method for the code that places the chip on the board~~
9. ~~Create a system that will detect if someone will win (horizontal and vertical for now)~~
10. ~~Add on to that system a diagonal win condition~~
11. Find a way to make the board load on the screen more smoothly, with different colours to make it more pleasing to the eye
12. ~~Have it so that the program detects a surplus of chips in a certain column and will tell the user to re-enter a column number (ie. Won't take in a value of 5 on the board if the 5 column is filled with chips)~~
13. ~~Add a replay functionality that asks the user whether or not they want to paly again after having compelted a match~~
14. ~~Fix bug of user entry where a user enters a number then a letter and it is accepted~~
15. Begin the process of a **computer opponent/AI** (try implementing the *minimax algorithm*)
16. Add a main menu to the game  
   More things to be added as development continues...
