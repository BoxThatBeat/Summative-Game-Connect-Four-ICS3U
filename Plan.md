### Goals
* Have a functioning game
* A nice and simple UI for easy interaction
* A nice list for the rules of the game
* Efficent use of code (Clean and effective)
* Have the program recognize win conditions for horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions

* Implement an AI/computer opponent (using minimax algorithm or by conceptualizing my own AI)

### Methods for the program
* Print the board
* Print the rules
* Take users' input
* Take users' input and place it on the board
* Error checker
* Win condition checker

### To-do List
1. ~~Create java file with the class file and main method~~
2. ~~Create the 2D array for the game board, get a sense for how 2D arrays work~~
3. ~~Create the board and have it printed~~
4. Create a list of rules for the game
5. ~~Create a system to take in users inputs and place it on the board~~
6. ~~Make a method for user inputs~~
7. Allow more than one colour to appear on the game board (two player functionality)
8. Make a method for the code that places the chip on the board
   More things to be added as development continues...
